# hamming Code Detection & Correction 



# Hamming Code and algorithm : 

It is a way of detecting errors using parity bits into Binary numbers. Data in computers when transfered from a device to another , 
it has a proccess of encoding and decoding and some data while transfering  get  flipped bit or bits. In order to detect the flipped bit or bits in the transfered data we need to use an algorithm. One of the oldest algorithm that detects and corrects those bits is Hamming Code Algorithm. Invented by Richard Hamming


# Getting Started : 

- This code is written in JavaScript as a web page project for the second year. It has three files HTML, CSS and JS.  you can go and download them to take a look at the web page. The project language is Turkish since it is an assignment for my class Computer Architecture.

# How it works : 

- Enter a data (Binary number) into the first input place and press (onayla). 
- The data length is 4 , 8 or 16 bits.  
- After getting the hamming code you have the ability to change one bit from 0 to one. 
- Here the program will start detecting and correcting the flipped bit. 

# Updates : 

- The program is only working in single bit detection and corrrection. It could be updated to detect and correct more than one bit. 
- It does not show the whole process of detecting and Correcting the binary number such as showing how to find the parity number of bits
and show them in charts and this will make it a little educational and easy to understand.
